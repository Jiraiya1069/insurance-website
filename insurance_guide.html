    <h2>📄 Introduction to Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      Insurance is a financial product sold by insurance companies to safeguard you and/or your property against the risk of loss, damage, or theft.
      In exchange for a premium, the insurance provider promises to pay for specific financial losses during the term of the policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance acts as a safety net. It offers peace of mind, knowing that in the event of an unfortunate event, you will not bear the entire financial burden alone.
      It helps individuals, businesses, and governments manage risk and recover faster from losses.
